## Enabling Global Hotkeys for Zoom Meetings

To use the BWIT 3x5 Macro Keypad effectively with Zoom, you need to enable global hotkeys in Zoom. This ensures that the hotkeys work even when Zoom is not the active window. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Open Zoom Settings
1. Launch the Zoom application on your computer.
2. Click on your profile picture or initials in the top-right corner.
3. Select **Settings** from the dropdown menu.

### Step 2: Go to Keyboard Shortcuts
1. In the Settings window, click on **Keyboard Shortcuts** in the left-hand menu.
2. You will see a list of available shortcuts for various Zoom actions.

### Step 3: Enable Global Hotkeys
1. Locate the shortcuts you want to use with the macrokeypad (e.g., Mute/Unmute, Start/Stop Video, etc.).
2. Check the box labeled **Enable Global Shortcut** next to each action. This allows the shortcut to work even when Zoom is running in the background.

### Step 4: Test the Hotkeys
1. Use the BWIT 3x5 Macro Keypad to trigger the configured hotkeys.
2. Make sure that the actions (e.g., muting/unmuting, toggling video) work as expected, even when Zoom is not the active window.

By enabling global hotkeys, you can seamlessly control Zoom meetings using the BWIT 3x5 Macro Keypad without needing to switch to the Zoom application.
